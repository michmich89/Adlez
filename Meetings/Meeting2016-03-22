What kind of game?
What kind of UI?
One way of making progress in the game is earning money by maybe killing things, which then can be used to buy new stuff in a store
Obstacles in the game: For example a maze with enemies shooting/firing arrows which you have to avoid. Enemies blocking a pathway by walking back and forth.
Extra: Sound effects and cool animations could be done in the end to spice things up
Extra: Day/night cycle
